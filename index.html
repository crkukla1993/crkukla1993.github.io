					<h3>//About Me:</h3>
					<p>
						My name is Christopher Kukla. I have always like building and creating things; LEGOs were my favorite toy.
						During high school, I had taken multiple computer aided drafting courses. These courses got me interested in Engineering.
						I took that interest to Northern Illinois University, enrolling in their Mechanical Engineering program.
						Over time, I realized that engineering wasn't satisfying my passion to create. So, I left NIU, and went
						on to study at Illinois State University majoring in Computer Science. 
					</p>
					<p>
						My education has taught me a lot and so has my internship experience. I spent two summers and one
						winter break working as an intern at the Village of Palatine, Illinois. During my internship I 
						taught myself C#, ASP.NET, Javascript, and JQuery. I needed these languages to build the systems 
						that the Village still has in place today.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is more to me than just my education and my experience. I have a passion for development.
						I enjoy the time I spend programming. I want to create a good user experience. I want my work to show
						that I love, and care about what I do. The passion I have is what drives me. I hope that my passion 
						can drive your business.
